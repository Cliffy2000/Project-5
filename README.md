# Project-5
This is a visualization of the power usage of a few buildings on the Middlebury Campus. The buildings are chosen to represent a relatively wide range of buildings, from Bihall which natually would use a lot of power, to a few dorm buildings and facilities as well as the library. There is a slider on the bottom which allows further examination of the data from the past week. 

I used a line chart as it is able to capture the trend across time very well. It is also a good medium to compare different categories, or in this case different buildings. I chose to add animation to the lines as it can show the change in slopes clearly. 

The final result is close to the original design. I wanted to have a centerpiece while having a few other pie charts and other stuff on the side. But I got stuck on data science issues and could't figure out how to get the moion according to different categories. 

One of the main issues with this visualization is that it only has one component. The other smaller graphs playa really important role in the design. Another issue is that even though there are a lot of data points, having the points close to each other makes the curve really messy, but reducing the number of data used woudl risk overseeing spikes in power usage.
